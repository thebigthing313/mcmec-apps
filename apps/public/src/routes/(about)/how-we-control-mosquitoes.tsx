				<h1>How We Control Mosquitoes</h1>
				<h2>Integrated Mosquito Management</h2>
				<p>
					Integrated Mosquito Management is the scientifically based, best
					management practices that includes mosquito surveillance, public
					education, source reduction, biological control, and insecticide
					control. This method of mosquito control has been adopted by the MCMEC
					Commissioners and is endorsed by the NJ Agricultural Experiment
					Station (NJAES), Rutgers University, US Environmental Protection
					Agency (EPA), and the New Jersey Department of Environmental
					Protection (NJDEP).
				</p>
				<h2>Surveillance</h2>
				<p>
					All mosquito control actions start with surveillance. The Commission
					conducts surveillance for larval mosquitoes, adult mosquitoes, and
					mosquitoes that transmit diseases to humans. The Commission employs
					different types of mosquito traps to monitor the abundance of the
					adult mosquito populations and for the presence of disease in those
					mosquito populations. Mosquito larvae are monitored by visually
					inspecting stagnant water sources for larvae. Click to view Middlesex

				<h2>Public Education & Outreach</h2>
				<p>
					Public education is an essential part of any mosquito control program
					encourages the public to practice source reduction around their homes
					and protect themselves from mosquito-borne disease at home and when
					traveling. The Commission attends large public events as well as
					provides classroom lectures to schools and other groups.
				</p>
				<h2>Source Reduction</h2>
				<h3>Water Management</h3>
				<p>
					In many instances, stormwater facilities such as ditches may get
					clogged and create a mosquito habitat. The Commission’s Water
					Management Program may take actions to return the flow to the
					structure. Project completion may require a large investment of time
					and other resources. To maximize efforts, much of our work focuses on
					improving, cleaning, and restoring existing storm water structures to
					combat some of the prolific mosquito larval habitats in the County. In
					doing so, the Commission seeks to minimize the need for insecticide
					applications in these areas and provide long-term protection for
					residents from nuisance and disease-carrying mosquitoes.
				</p>
				<p>
					By following recommendations in the “Best Management Practices for
					Mosquito Control and Freshwater Wetlands Management,” all water
					management projects are done with a minimal amount of temporary
					disturbance to the surrounding environment. Re-vegetation of disturbed
					areas usually takes place within a few weeks of work being completed
					during the growing season. Water management projects are carried out
					under the authorization of various permits issued by the NJ Department
					of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). Many water management projects
					are carried out with the cooperation of other county departments and
					local municipalities.
				</p>
				<h3>Site Plan Reviews</h3>
				<p>
					The Commission reviews applications and plans submitted to the
					Middlesex County Planning Board Development Review Division for any
					potential mosquito issues. Occasionally, municipalities request
					Commission approval of proposed stormwater facilities not covered
					under the County Review Division. The Commission verifies proposed
					stormwater management systems follow County guidelines as well as the
					NJDEP's as stated in the NJDEP's Stormwater Best Management Practices
					manual for any potential issues relating to mosquito production. Upon
					review of site plans, the Commission forwards a report to the County
					Planning Board with recommendations for revisions if necessary.
				</p>
				<h3>Tire Recycling</h3>
				<p>
					Improperly stored or illegally disposed tires can collect water and
					become habitats for large populations of mosquito that can transmit
					potentially fatal diseases such as eastern equine encephalitis, West
					Nile virus, chikungunya, Zika and dengue fever. By removing illegally
					dumped tires, the Commission staff eliminate mosquito habitat. The
					Commission has collected and recycled over 100,000 tires from
					routinely inspected habitats since the beginning of the abatement
					program.{" "}

				<h2>Biological Control</h2>
				<p>
					The Commission also stocks mosquito-eating fish in unkempt swimming
					pools, small ponds and other standing water bodies that may breed
					mosquitoes. While not eliminating the habitat, biological control can
					be an inexpensive, efficient, and environmentally friendly means of
					controlling mosquito populations. Fish are stocked according to
					guidelines provided by the NJDEP State Mosquito Control Commission
					(SMCC) and the Office of Mosquito Control Coordination (OMCC).{" "}

				<h2>Insecticide Control</h2>
				<h3>Larval Control</h3>
				<p>
					Over 14,000 (potential) larval habitat sites are inspected and
					serviced on a regular basis by the Mosquito Commission. The
					Commission's NJDEP-licensed Inspectors regularly check these sites for
					mosquitoes and treat them with insecticides when mosquitoes are found.
					Some of these sources are large floodplains and swamps capable of
					periodically producing a great number of mosquitoes. Due their size
					and lack of accessibility they are best{" "}

				<h3>Adult Mosquito Control</h3>
				<p>
					The Commission monitors nuisance and disease-causing mosquitoes
					throughout the mosquito season using specialized traps. Should an
					infected mosquito be found or if mosquito populations exceed nuisance
					thresholds, insecticides (adulticides) are used to control them.
					Adulticides are applied using truck-mounted sprayers or aerially by
					helicopter. To find out if an application is planned for your area
