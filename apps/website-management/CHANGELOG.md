### Major Changes

- 76ce7e8: Railway migration Phase 4 — rewire the `website-management` app to the new backend.

  **website-management** — auth moves to the Better Auth cookie client, with the app self-hosting its own `/login` and the `(app)` guard verifying `manage_website` (renamed from `public_notices`). All content reads stream from ElectricSQL collections and writes go through the Hono API.

  The four public-intake surfaces (adult mosquito, mosquitofish, water management, contact submissions) collapse into **one "Public Requests" section** backed by the merged `public_requests` table, with request-type and status filters, a triage view that renders each type's `details` generically, and delete. Staff-entered requests are gone: the backend accepts submissions only from the public site's Turnstile-gated intake endpoint, so the four staff create-forms were removed along with the per-type tables and edit forms.

  Spray-schedule municipality links now go through the API's junction endpoints, and the weekly-activity CSV upload posts to the bulk import endpoint — which replaces only the years present in the file instead of wiping the whole dataset, so the confirmation copy changed to match. Audit columns (`created_by`/`updated_by`) are gone from every form and the "Creator" column was dropped from the notices and documents tables. Requires `VITE_API_URL`.

  **@mcmec/supabase** — the notices collection factory gained an on-demand `mosquitoActivityData` collection so the weekly-activity charts read live instead of paging through PostgREST.

  **api** — new `GET /api/spray-schedules/municipalities` (gated `manage_website`) returning the junction rows. The junction has a composite primary key and no `id`, so it can't be an Electric collection; this is its read path.

- 76ce7e8: Rename the `notices` app to `website-management`.

  The app long ago outgrew its name — it manages every kind of content published on the public website (notices, meetings, insecticides, spray schedules, documents, service requests, weekly activity), not just notices. The workspace package and directory are now `website-management`, the UI calls it "Website Management", and the dev server moved from port 3002 to 3006 (3002 collides with other local tooling).

  The `notices` domain itself is unchanged — the `notices` table, its collections, and the public site's `/notices` routes keep their names.

  **Deployment follow-up:** the production subdomain moves `notices.middlesexmosquito.org` → `website.middlesexmosquito.org` (declared in `@mcmec/lib`'s app registry and the API's `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`), and the Vercel project's root directory must be repointed at `apps/website-management`.

### Patch Changes

- 76ce7e8: Seed edit forms from the live row instead of a one-shot read.

  Route loaders read a collection once — `await c.preload()` then `c.get(id)`. `preload()` resolves when the sync layer marks the collection ready, which Electric does on the `up-to-date` control message — and that message does not mean "current as of now". It arrives on the log catch-up request, which the shape proxy passes through with Electric's `cache-control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300`. A cold page load can therefore replay a cached catch-up ending in `up-to-date`, mark the collection ready, and hand the loader rows up to ~60 seconds old, or ~6 minutes under stale-while-revalidate. The live long-poll lands moments later and the collection converges, but the loader has already read.

  That was not merely cosmetic. `onUpdate` sends the diff between the submitted form value and the live collection row, so any field left stale in the seed differs from current and is written back — silently reverting whatever else had changed, with no error and no warning. The previous PostgREST reads were always current, so this only appeared with the move to synced collections.

  The five edit routes (notices, documents, meetings, insecticides, spray schedules) and the two detail views (notices, documents) now read their record from a live query. Because TanStack Form reads `defaultValues` only on mount, re-seeding means remounting, so the form carries a `key` derived from the row's `updated_at`. That key is latched on the first focus inside the form: until you touch it, it tracks the live row; afterwards it is yours, and a sync landing mid-edit will not pull text out from under you. Whoever saves last wins.

  The spray schedule's municipality set lives in a separate collection with no `updated_at` of its own, so its linked ids are folded into the version stamp.

- 8ed561d: Make the frontends deployable on Railway.

  Vercel supplied two things these apps silently depended on: a static file server with an SPA
  rewrite, and a build pipeline that knew which app it was building. A Railway service supplies
  neither — it gives you a container and runs your start command. Nothing here could boot.

  **Static serving.** The four SPAs gain `sirv-cli` as a runtime dependency and a start script,
  `sirv dist --single --etag --host 0.0.0.0`. `--single` restores the SPA fallback, without which
  every deep link 404s on refresh. `--host 0.0.0.0` is not optional: `sirv-cli` defaults `--host`
  to `localhost`, so the container would bind loopback and Railway would return 502 with the
  process apparently healthy. It is a regular dependency rather than a devDependency because the
  production install prunes devDependencies.

  **`public`'s start script was broken.** It pointed at `dist/server/server.js` via a `pnpx srvx`
  invocation, but the build emits `.output/server/index.mjs` and `srvx` was never a dependency.
  `pnpm --filter public start` failed on any machine; nothing had run it, so it went unnoticed and
  would have failed on the first SSR deploy. It is now `node .output/server/index.mjs`.

  **Per-service config.** Each app carries `apps/<app>/railway.json` with its own build command,
  start command and watch patterns. This matters because the repo-root `railway.json` belongs to
  `api` and starts with `db:migrate` — any service rooted at the repo root without an explicit
  config path would read it and try to boot the API.

  **Cookie namespacing.** `COOKIE_PREFIX` now namespaces the session cookie. Staging hosts are
  siblings of production under the same parent domain, and the SSO cookie is scoped to that
  shared parent, so without distinct prefixes both environments write the same cookie name at
  the same scope: signing into staging would clobber a production session and vice versa, and
  each API would then receive the other environment's token and reject it. Left alone that
  presents as sporadic unexplained logouts rather than as an error. Unset falls back to Better
  Auth's default, which is correct for local dev.

  `docs/railway-deployment.md` records the topology, per-service settings, build-time variable
  rules, the domain and cookie table, and the dashboard-only steps.

- 76ce7e8: Give `spray_schedule_municipalities` a surrogate `id` so the junction can sync as a collection.

  **api** — migration `0003` drops the composite primary key, adds `id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()`, and keeps the pair unique via `spray_schedule_municipalities_pair_key`. Existing rows keep their pairs and pick up generated ids. Writes still go through `PUT /api/spray-schedules/:id/municipalities` — replacing a schedule's whole set is one transaction, not a series of row writes — but the short-lived `GET /api/spray-schedules/municipalities` added alongside it is gone, since clients now read the junction from its Electric shape.

  **@mcmec/supabase** — new `SprayScheduleMunicipalitiesRowSchema` and a read-only `sprayScheduleMunicipalities` collection in the notices factory.

  **website-management** — the spray-schedule screens read municipality links from the collection instead of polling an endpoint, so a municipality write syncs back on its own with no query invalidation.

- f609219: Keep every deployment except the production public site out of search results.

  `public` sets `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` from a Nitro response hook and serves a
  `Disallow: /` robots.txt whenever it is not production, so staging cannot be indexed as a
  duplicate of the Commission's official channel for legal notices. The switch asks whether the
  environment _is_ production rather than whether it is staging, so a service missing its
  configuration declines to be indexed instead of quietly appearing in search results.

  The four staff apps carry a `noindex` meta tag and a `Disallow: /` robots.txt in every
  environment — they have no public audience anywhere.
